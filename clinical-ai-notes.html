                        In healthcare, moments of insight happen in conversations—during hallway consults, quick phone updates, and bedside evaluations. Yet these critical details often go undocumented or are hastily captured in unstructured formats, leaving gaps in patient care and communication.<br><br>

                        We saw this first-hand in our 130,000+ NHS clinician communication app, where vital exchanges of clinical knowledge were often ephemeral, lacking the structure needed for seamless follow-up or analysis. Pando's Clinical AI Note tool set out to bridge that gap—not just by capturing these conversations, but by turning them into organized, interoperable clinical records.<br><br>

                        As Director of Product and investor, I led defining the vision and product strategy, and it started with Pando Clinical AI Notes, an ambient AI-driven solution designed to transform clinical conversations into structured, shareable, and actionable medical documentation.<br><br>

                        This initiative laid the groundwork for Pando's broader vision: to empower clinicians with personalized AI agents—intelligent, context-aware, and seamlessly integrated—to enhance their workflows, improve decision-making, and elevate the standard of patient care.<br><br>

                        The art of product is in how you navigate strategic tradeoffs and pivots to achieve your vision and execute on the business's goals so I will focus on that for this case study.

                        When we acquired Pando, a clinical communications app with 130,000 NHS clinicians and 200+ hospital systems, the CEO challenged me to integrate AI into our existing platform with two clear goals: attract investment and redefine our product strategy. As both a Director of Product and an investor, I saw a unique opportunity to leverage the rich clinical conversations happening daily on our platform. We weren't just sitting on communication data; we were sitting on actionable medical insights.

                            <li>Pivot: Introduced 5 free notes per user during the pilot, with Trust-level authorization required for further use.</li>
                            <li>Why: Reduce friction for initial adoption and demonstrate value before asking Trusts to commit.</li>

                        Although full deployment was paused to rebuild Pando’s infrastructure, Clinical AI Notes did exactly what it was intended to:

                        <li>Attract Investment: The prototype was used in investor demos to validate our strategic pivot and long-term potential.</li>
                        <li>Validate Market Demand: Direct testing with Trusts proved the value of structured conversational data.</li>
                        <li>Inform Future Roadmap: We mapped out what infrastructure was needed and secured commitments to continue after the rebuild.</li>

                        My role was to define the vision, build the strategy, and execute with speed and precision, constantly adapting to new information while staying aligned with business goals. We weren’t just building a product; we were setting the foundation to monetize clinical conversations in ways that could transform patient care and power up real-world evidence for Pharma.
